# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js  --network rinkeby
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js  --network localhost

yarn hardhat node
```
