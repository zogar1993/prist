# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts  --network rinkeby
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts  --network localhost

yarn hardhat node

yarn hardhat clean
yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat coverage
yarn hardhat typechain
```
